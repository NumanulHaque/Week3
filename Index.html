            all time.In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports
            Personality of the Century by the BBC.Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an
            amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer
            Olympics and turned professional later that
            year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a
            major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he denounced his birth name as a "slave name"
            and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
